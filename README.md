# Adventure-Game
Adventure Game is an app which users can decide the flow of story. According to their decisions, the story reestablishes. In this app, I used MVC(Model-View-Controller) pattern to build my app. If we go into more detail, story and storyBrain files are located in Model folder. Furthermore, View folder has main file and finally ViewController is in Controller folder. Besides, I used struct, dictionary and function to create the app.
